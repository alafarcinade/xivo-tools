TODO :
It does not ease 
* Group,
* Conference rooms,
* Queues,
* Agents,
re-configuration.


Pre-requisities
===============

* Have access to the XiVO 1.1 MySQL DB,


Process
=======

#. Copy script on XiVO 1.1,
#. Launch script
#. The script creates a new directory::

    Migration-1.1-to-12

#. It contains the CSV file for XiVO 12 which can import users with their associated DID and 
Voicemail::
    
    users.csv : users import file for XiVO 12 version,

#. and several manual_* files which are intended to give hint regarding the manual configuration 
which has to be done::

    manual_users_dialaction.csv : 
    manual_users_funckey.csv : lists users which have phone function keys configured,
    manual_users_musiconhold.csv : lists users which have a moh different from 'default' or none,
    manual_users_ringseconds.csv : lists users which have a ring second parameter different from 30s,
    manual_users_simultcalls.csv : lists users which have a simult calls parameter different from 5,
    manual_users_subroutine.csv : lists users which have a pre-process subroutine configured,
    manual_users_dialaction.csv : lists users which have dialaction different from 'none',
    manual_users_custom_protocol_line.csv : lists users which are not SIP or SCCP or IAX users,
    manual_voicemail.csv : lists voicemails which are not linked to a user,
    manual_incall.csv : lists incalls which have a destination different from a user,

#. import the users in the XiVO 12 via the users.csv file,
#. read the manual_* files and report the according changes in the XiVO 12 configuration
